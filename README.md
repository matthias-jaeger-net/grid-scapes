# grid-scapes

>The cross-divisional work grid-scapes combines methods from photography, computer science and graphic design. The aim of this connection is to create an independent aesthetic. The series starts with photographs of landscapes in the Styrian highlands. The further processing is to be understood as a darkroom in which is being developed. A grid is placed over the picture. In each cell, the algorithm measures the color at the center. The values for red, green and blue are visualized with a line. Length, line width and rotation of the line depend on the colors. The end product is an abstract line graphic which is the visualization of the data and equally the picture itself.
